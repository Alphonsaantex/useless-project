### Project Description
This project is based on the current mood of a soap dispenser , after finishing the soap it will refill automatically

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[What ridiculous problem are you solving?]
Humans have two major daily crises:

    Not knowing what mood their soap dispenser is in.

    The emotional trauma of discovering the soap bottle is empty mid-wash.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We‚Äôve created the world‚Äôs first emotionally intelligent soap dispenser. Using advanced mood-detection algorithms (read: color-coded LEDs and vague machine learning), the dispenser shows its current emotional state.
